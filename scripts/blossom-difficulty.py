"""How hard a Blossom board is to solve.

A board's difficulty is the ACROSS score of its easiest solution, over every
solution up to the generator chain's length -- the easiest is often not the
shortest. Easiest is decided by WITHIN: which solution a player finds is a
within-board ranking, scoring it against other boards is not.

Two vectors because taking a minimum over solutions selects for low obscurity,
so word terms compress across board floors while geometry terms do not. Over 139
multi-solution boards obs_max varies 0.48x as much across floors as within a
board, against 2.55x for old_frac and 3.15x for hint. WITHIN is fitted on 30
pairwise human judgments (27/30). ACROSS is set from per-term agreement over 31
board comparisons: fitting it scored 13/25 leave-one-out against 17/25 for the
set vector.

Scores pass through k*log1p((s+0.80)/k), k=1.2. Monotone, so it reorders
nothing; it compresses the top, where boards stop being distinguishable.

Terms are oriented so larger is harder. Two need explaining:

  obscurity  2.58 - prevalence, the probit proportion of people who report
             knowing the word. Word, then lemma, then imputed from log frequency
             (53% / 92% / full coverage of words.js). A lemma's prevalence does
             not carry to a surface form the corpus does not attest: CHOICEST
             resolved to CHOICE and scored 0.00, the ceiling, on a form of
             frequency 0 against the lemma's 77,197. Plurals are exempt, being
             fully productive.
  ungen      steps gen.js placeLetter would not have taken. Its hexDistance
             tie-break must be copied exactly -- an offset-to-cube conversion
             disagrees on 63% of cell pairs and makes the generator's own chain
             look ungeneratable.

Over 500 boards: mean 0.499, sd 0.143, IQR 0.196 of an observed 0.85 range.
Median spread between solutions on one board is 0.856, 6.0x the sd of board
difficulty, so which solution a player finds matters more than which board they
were given. 86% of boards have an easiest solution with ungen 0.

Chain length is not modelled: it cannot be isolated in this pool, which holds
4,093 boards at 6 words against 54 at 4. Tested and dropped: word length,
reading direction, n-gram entropy, word self-overlap, orthographic
neighbourhood, concreteness, word_bank membership, obscurity across boards.

Requires prevalence.tsv (word<TAB>probit; Brysbaert et al. US probit norms) and
frequency.txt (word<SPACE>count; any large list), in scripts/data/ or --data DIR
or BLOSSOM_DATA. Neither is redistributed, as with the SCOWL dictionary behind
words.js.
