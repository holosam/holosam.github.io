# Post Ideas

Within each section, topics are ordered by my interest / eagerness to dive in.

## Ready

Strong idea of the content right now, just need to write it up

- Turbo vs. Zen mode ([ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14m3ix21t8Jx4R2tsjSNMlMSvDUC6gnolbPm4-YM_bMM/edit?tab=t.0))
`[Psychology]`
- Valuing accomplishments made by humans vs. AI `[Philosophy]` - depends on dimensions like art vs. science (see notebook)
- Blossom word game `[Projects]` - game design and screenshots, what's next
- MCP is dead? `[Tech]` - cloudflare code mode shows that API code generation beats tool calls, expect MCP to be good for inline apps, but executing code on isolates is way more scalable

## Soon

Decent idea of the concept and could flesh it out in maybe 2-3 hours

- Swarm intelligence `[Projects]` - discuss the simple "rules" of how ants operate simply, to form an intelligent colony. And perhaps the learning for AI isn't to make the single smartest model, but a series of specialized models that contribute/vote
- Personal coaching / continued improvement `[Philosophy]` - as adults we just "learn on the job" rather than deliberately training with reps, some related materials: [coach in the operating room](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/03/personal-best), [the expert myth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eW6Eagr9XA)
- Mental fortitude needed to be an F1 driver `[Psychology]` - links [1](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/fit-for-f1-the-mental-preparation-drivers-need-to-succeed.3ucowVTtOPYbparlWl2cjZ), [2](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/f1-explains-how-the-drivers-prepare-themselves-mentally-to-cope-with-the.4tMHexcIsInIIoKdSskp4x), also interview F3 driver?
- Dark matter `[Ideas]` - 3-body Problem's visualization of dimensions (2D pacman), perhaps implying that dark matter is 4th dimensional
- Internet watchtime `[Ideas]` - pay a subscription to an internet without ads, which gets doled out to the owners of sites you spend time on

## Backlog

Shallow idea or piece of inspiration, but not yet sure what's worth digging into

- [OpenROV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenROV) `[Off-topic]` - open source builders who contribute to a hobby


## Overflow

Trying to keep these lists focused and realistic, but look [here for even fainter ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zgAWTwjehxboF3ZwSJ92kK6osB7SQC8jy0BD1ReBLkU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.veahefdas15t).
