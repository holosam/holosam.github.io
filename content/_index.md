# Sammy's Blog

I'm Sammy Farid and I work in tech in the Bay Area. I live with my wife and two cats, and I like dark chocolate, drumming, and Formula 1.

Right now I'm building <a href="http://flightcrew.io/" target="_blank">Flightcrew</a>, and I sometimes write about my experience and other interests here.
