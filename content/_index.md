# Sammy's Blog

<img align="right" width="120px" src="/profile.png" alt="profile photo">

I'm Sammy Farid and I work in tech in the Bay Area. I live with my wife and two cats, and I like dark chocolate, drumming, and Formula 1. Right now I'm building <a href="http://flightcrew.io/" target="_blank">Flightcrew</a>.

This site is a space for me to explore off-topic ideas and projects, with each post acting as a checkpoint for my current thinking or progress.
